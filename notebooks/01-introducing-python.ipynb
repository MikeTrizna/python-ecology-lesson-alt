    "## Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general purpose language. In practical terms, that means it dispenses with many of the complexities of writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A core philosophical tenet of Python is that code is read more often than it is written. Best practices for coding in Python therefore emphasize writing well-documented, consistently formatted code that follows language-wide standards. **In a Pythonic world, everyone's code would look the same.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python is an *object*. Each object has a *type*, which controls what the kind of things the object can do. For example, you can add integers together or append a string to a list. An object can be *assigned* to a *variable*, and a *function* performs an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an *object-oriented language*. This means that each object includes built-in variables and functions that can be used from the object itself. When working from an object, we use different terms to refer to these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ an *attribute* stores a piece of data\n",
    "+ a *method* performs an action\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one of the main built-in types, `str`, to see how this works in practice. In Python, `str`, short for string, is used to store and manipulate text. To get started, we'll assign the string \"hello world\" to the variable **text**. In Python, we use a single equal sign for assignment and use quotes to define the string."
